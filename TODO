MUD
	Scripting Engine
	     Research language
			   Research features
		 	   Research requirements for embedding
	     What will the scope of the scripting engine be?
	     	  Rooms
			Used to define rooms?
			     Can define properties and behavior simultaneously
			     	 Inherit from premade types
			Alternatively, attached to rooms via hooks or events
				       Less flexible
				       More uniform, easier to create
		Objects

	Data Persistence
	     Design data model
	     	    What is your data?
		    	 Accounts
				Password
				Email
				Statistics
				Characters
					Statistics, skills, abilities, inventory
					data/metadata storage
			 Objects
			 Craft
				Rooms
				Location
	     	    How will you accomodate expandability?
		    	Events
				Allow creation of event types?
		    	Hooks
			Rooms/items/objects = functions?
					    Depends somewhat on scripting engine
	     Research LMDB
	     	      How to organize data?
		      	  Work out what your data will look like
		      What are the limitations of simple kvps
	     Research Sqlite / LightningSQL
			Associated data is more naturally organized
			Will I get locked into a data model
	Network
		Telnet
			MCCP/MCCP2/MCCP3 support
			What to do about clients in char mode

		ANSI Escape Codes
		     ANSI Colors
		     Do I want to support terminal drawing
		     	Most people don't use clients that support this
